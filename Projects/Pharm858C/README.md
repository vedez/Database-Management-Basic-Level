# Pharm858C: Relational Database Project
## Project Overview
In the Pharm858C project, my partner and I were tasked with designing and implementing a relational database, drawing from a specific extract provided to us. Our primary objective was to develop a database structure with well-defined tables and attributes, ensuring it supports all the functionalities required by the various roles outlined in the extract.

## Team Collaboration
We worked collaboratively to determine the most effective database schema and the corresponding attributes for each table. This collaborative phase was crucial in ensuring that our database design was comprehensive and tailored to meet the project's requirements.

## My Role and Contribution
As part of our individual work, I focused on the role of "George," a character responsible for adding prescriptions into the system. My key contributions in this role were:

### SQL Procedure Development: 
I crafted a specialized SQL procedure to facilitate the addition of prescriptions. This procedure was central to enabling the core functionality of the database from George's perspective.

### Integration with Python: 
To enhance the usability and accessibility of the SQL procedure, I integrated it with Python, specifically using the Pandas library. This integration allowed for a more seamless and efficient interaction with the database, making the process of adding prescriptions more streamlined and user-friendly.

#### Technologies Used
SQL: For database procedures and management.
Python (Pandas): For calling SQL functions and handling data.

## Project Impact
This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to delve deeply into relational database design and the practical aspects of implementing database functionalities. It also provided valuable insights into working collaboratively on complex tasks and integrating different technologies for effective solutions.
